-border around divs
-if player x turn, 'onclick' innertext = x (for gameboard)
-start button

-random generator for computer
    -array of div id's 
    -generate random number between 1 and 8 insert into cell-# format w/lookup table (status?)

-status //disabled buttons 
-buttons that fill each div, gives clickability and disability, -give borders for the buttons 
-adding status -- look at GJ's code

if 3 cells in a row = each other then select those cells and text-decoration: strikethrough

logic for getting crossout/winning
if cell0.innertext === cell1.innertext && cell0.innertext === cell2.innertext => text-decoration strikethrough OR the border of the button flashes or change color w/e 


when you hit start button, status will change to player x's turn 
--> they choose a cell, it populates with x 
--> --> status changes to player o's turn
cycle through that until winner or draw


making the function playerXTurn conditional based off of which player's turn 

if system status = x, do this 
-->at end of this change status to o, do this

make the status equal X after they choose a cell, status !== x and so equals O // true or false 
let x = status === true || = o
