-border around divs
-if player x turn, 'onclick' innertext = x (for gameboard)
-start button

-random generator for computer
    -array of div id's 
    -generate random number between 1 and 8 insert into cell-# format w/lookup table (status?)

-status //disabled buttons 
-buttons that fill each div, gives clickability and disability, -give borders for the buttons 
-adding status -- look at GJ's code

if 3 cells in a row = each other then select those cells and text-decoration: strikethrough

logic for getting crossout/winning
if cell0.innertext === cell1.innertext && cell0.innertext === cell2.innertext => text-decoration strikethrough OR the border of the button flashes or change color w/e 


----winning conditions----
-if XMoves + OMoves = 9 then it is a draw and nobody wins (if nobody has won yet)



-check if innerText of the cells if length > 0 ...disable button 



TODO:

- finish win condition
    -- print WHO won.. not just that someone won
- style everything
- maker computer player (dumb to start.. using random)
-get the system to draw line through winning cells 
-names
